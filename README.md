# 🧠 Missing Persons Face Recognition API

This Flask-based API system allows registration of missing persons with their details and images, and supports face recognition to match unknown images with stored records.

## 📊 Notes

* Face encodings are stored in the database as JSON.
* The `known_people/` folder holds saved face images.
* Confidence scores are derived using face distance from the recognition model.
* You can adjust `tolerance=0.6` in `compare_faces()` to tune accuracy.
